\chapter{Future developments}
\label{chap:futuredevelopments}

Here we list briefly some of the developments that we are working on. We also discuss a few suboptimal features of the current version of the toolbox.

\section{Data types}

Currently, we distinguish between \textit{tasks}, but not between \textit{types} of data (e.g. real-valued vectors, graphs, sequences, etc.). We plan on including this distinction in the future.

\section{Load balancer}

Experiments are distributed throughout the workers in a fully random way. We plan on implementing a more efficient load balancer, that should take into consideration the average training time of the algorithms, together with the characteristics of the hardware.

\section{Web service}

We would like to implement a web service where to expose additional functionalities developed by the users, that can be downloaded automatically from the toolbox itself.
